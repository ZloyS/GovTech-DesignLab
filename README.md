(SOT86081) GovTech Design Lab: Harnessing AI, Earth Observation and Data Storytelling to Tackle Climate Security and Conflict

This course is designed to equip Master students with the essential tools and insights needed to effectively build and use technology for driving positive impact in global affairs. In this inaugural year of the course, the focus will be on the issue of climate security and geospatial data.

The course is clustered into three thematic segments:

● The first segment - Climate & Conflict - offers an overview of the main frontiers of conflict and decision-making, the processing and application of geospatial data, and climate change modeling;

● The second segment - Geospatial Tech - examines the utilization of storytelling techniques to effectively communicate complex narratives;

● The third segment - Storytelling & Learning - will be the TUM Project Week, where students will have time to implement their projects (5 days).

As a Teaching Assistant, I was in tasked with making Jupyter Notebooks that outline the ways to access geospatial datasets using Google Earth Engine API, Copernicus API, etc. Also, given the diversity of students' background with varying levels of programming expertise, it was crucial to incorporate common methods for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualization, as well as data management techniques.
